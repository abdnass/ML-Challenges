# ML-Challenges
These are solution of Challenges proposed in Machine Learning cours by Prof: Philipp Peterson.

# Challenge 1: The mysterious Machine.
This is a classification problem where we try to predict if a machine Runs or Not.

# Challenge 2: The Freezing Fritz.
The Freezing Fritz is a pretty cool guy. He has one problem, though. In his house, it is quite often too cold
or to hot during the night. Then he has to get up and open or close his windows or turn the heat up or
down. Needless to say, he would like to avoid this.
However, his flat has three doors that he can keep open or closed, it has four radiators, and four windows.
There is a picture of his home in Figure 12. It seems like there are endless possibilities of prepping the flat
for whatever temperature the night will have.
Fritz, does not want to play his luck any longer and decided to get active. He recorded the temperature
outside and inside of his bedroom for the last two years. Now he would like to find a prediction that,
given the outside temperature, as well as a certain configuration of his flat, tells him how cold or warm
his bedroom will become.
